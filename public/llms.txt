> Documentation for building on Metaplex protocol - NFTs, tokens, and digital assets on Solana.

---

## Canonical Definitions

- **Metaplex**: An open-source protocol for creating, selling, and managing digital assets on Solana.
- **Metaplex Core**: The current-generation Solana digital asset standard. Recommended for all new NFT and digital asset projects.
- **Asset**: A Core on-chain account representing ownership, metadata, and plugins. The fundamental unit in Metaplex Core.
- **Collection**: A group of related Assets managed together, with shared settings and metadata.
- **Plugin**: A modular extension attached to a Core Asset or Collection that adds behavior (royalties, transfer rules, freezing, delegates, etc.).
- **Delegate**: A role granting limited authority over an Asset without transferring ownership.
- **Token Metadata**: The legacy NFT metadata standard. Still supported but Core is recommended for new projects.
- **Candy Machine**: A minting and distribution program for launching NFT collections with configurable rules (allowlists, payment, limits).
- **Bubblegum**: A compression system for creating large-scale NFT collections at reduced cost using Merkle trees.
- **Genesis**: A token launch platform for launching tokens on Solana via launch pools, presales, and uniform price auctions.
- **UMI**: A Solana framework for building JavaScript clients, used by all Metaplex SDKs.
- **DAS API**: Digital Asset Standard API for querying indexed NFT data from RPC providers.

## Important Distinctions

- **Genesis** is for launching **tokens** (fungible). **Candy Machine** is for launching **NFTs** (non-fungible).
- Metaplex Core is **not** the same as Token Metadata. Core is the newer, recommended standard.
- Core Assets are **not** SPL Tokens. They use a single-account design, not the SPL Token program.
- Bubblegum creates compressed NFTs that are fully compatible with Core plugins.
- Candy Machine is a minting tool, not an asset standard. It creates either Core Assets or Token Metadata NFTs.
- "Metaplex NFT" typically refers to Token Metadata NFTs (legacy). New projects should use "Core Assets".
