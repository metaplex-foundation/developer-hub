# Metaplex Developer Hub

> The Metaplex Protocol is a decentralized platform built on the Solana blockchain, designed to facilitate the creation, sale, and management of digital assets. It offers tools and standards for developers, creators and businesses to launch tokens and NFTs on Solana and the SVM.

The Metaplex Developer Hub is a documentation website that serves as the central hub for all Metaplex-related documentation including Core, Candy Machine, UMI, Token Metadata, and other MPL products. The site provides comprehensive guides, API references, and tutorials for building with Metaplex protocols.
