description: A detailed overview of Sugar, a CLI tool for managing Candy Machines.
---

Sugar is a command-line tool to interact with Candy Machines. It allows you to manage the whole lifecycle of a Candy Machine and has the following advantages:

- single configuration file with all Candy Machine settings;
- better performance for upload of media/metadata files and deploy of a Candy Machine &mdash; these operations take advantage of multithreaded systems to significantly speed up the computational time needed;
- robust error handling and validation of inputs with informative error messages;
- state is maintain even if a command is stopped â€“ e.g., if your upload fails, you can re-run the upload and only the failed ones are retried.

Setting up Sugar is as simple as opening your favourite terminal application and downloading a binary file.
