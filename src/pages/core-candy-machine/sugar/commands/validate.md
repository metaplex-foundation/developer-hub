The `validate` command is used to check that all files in the assets folder are in the correct format:

```
sugar validate
```

If your assets are in a folder other than the default `assets`, you can specify the folder name:

```
sugar validate <ASSETS FOLDER>
```

{% callout %}

It is important to validate your assets before the upload to avoid having to repeat the upload process.

{% /callout %}
