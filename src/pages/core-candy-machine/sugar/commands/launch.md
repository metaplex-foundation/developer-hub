description: launch command.

The `launch` command is a convenience command that runs five other commands consecutively:

- `create-config`
- `validate`
- `upload`
- `deploy`
- `verify`

These five commands allow you to start from a project folder with an assets subfolder in it and go through the entire process of setting up and creating a Candy Machine, so it's meant as a quickstart command if you don't want to run each step individually.
