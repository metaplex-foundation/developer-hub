You can use the `collection`` commands to manually set the collection NFT of your Candy Machine. You can only modify the collection before any NFTs have been minted from it.

You can set a pre-existing collection NFT by running:

```
sugar collection set <COLLECTION MINT>
```

where `<COLLETION MINT>` is the public key of the collection NFT mint account.
