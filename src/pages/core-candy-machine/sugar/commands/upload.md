The `upload`` command uploads assets to the specified storage and creates the cache file for the Candy Machine.

You upload all assets using the default asset folder location (e.g., `assets` folder on the current directory) with the following command:

```
sugar upload
```

Alternatively, you can specify a different folder:

```
sugar upload <ASSETS DIR>
```

{% callout %}

The `upload` command can be resumed (re-run) at any point in case the upload is not completed successfully â€” only files that have not yet been uploaded are processed. It also automatically detects when the content of media/metadata files changes and re-uploads them, updating the cache file accordingly. In other words, if you need to change a file, you only need to copy the new (modified) file to your assets folder and re-run the upload command. There is no need to manually edit the cache file.
