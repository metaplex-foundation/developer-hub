description: Learn how to verify the creators of an Nft on Token Metadata
---

Similarly to [collections](/token-metadata/collections), the creators of an Nft must be verified to ensure the authenticity of the Nft. {% .lead %}

A creator whose `verified` flag is `false` could have been added by anyone and, therefore, cannot be trusted. On the other hand, a creator whose `verified` flag is `true` is guaranteed to have signed a transaction that verified them as a creator of that Nft.

In the section below, we will learn how to verify and unverify the creators of an Nft. Note that before verifying a creator, it must already be part of the **Creators** array of the Nft's **Metadata** account. This can be done when [minting the Nft](/token-metadata/mint) but also when [updating the Nft](/token-metadata/update).

## Verify a Creator

The **Verify** instruction can be used to verify the creator of an Nft. Notice that the same instruction can also be used to verify collections providing we pass different arguments to the instruction. Some of our SDKs split these instructions into multiple helpers like `verifyCreatorV1` and `verifyCollectionV1` to provide a better developer experience.

The main attributes required by the **Verify** instruction in the context of verifying a creator are the following:

- **Metadata**: The address of the Nft's **Metadata** account.
- **Authority**: The creator we are trying to verify as a Signer.

Here's how we can use our SDKs to verify a creator on Token Metadata.

{% dialect-switcher title="Verify a Creator" %}
{% dialect title="JavaScript" id="js" %}

```ts
import { verifyCreatorV1 } from '@metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata'

await verifyCreatorV1(umi, {
  metadata,
  authority: creator,
}).sendAndConfirm(umi)
```

{% /dialect %}
{% /dialect-switcher %}

## Unverify a Creator

Reciprocally, the **Unverify** instruction can be used to turn the `verified` flag of a creator to `false`. It accepts the same attributes as the **Verify** instruction and can be used in the same way.

{% dialect-switcher title="Unverify a Creator" %}
{% dialect title="JavaScript" id="js" %}

```ts
import { unverifyCreatorV1 } from '@metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata'

await unverifyCreatorV1(umi, {
  metadata,
  authority: creator,
}).sendAndConfirm(umi)
```

{% /dialect %}
{% /dialect-switcher %}
