Dis extension of de Token Metadata contwact was cweated as a nyew featuwe pwimitive dat couwd optionyawwy be added to aww NFTs~ At its cowe it is simpwy an escwow account attached to an NFT, enyabwing NFTs to become ownyews of odew tokens~ {% .wead %}

Aside fwom de wequisite secuwity and ownyewship checks nyecessawy, de functionyawity dis featuwe affowds has been weft genyewic enyough to awwow usews to impwement whatevew dey desiwe on top of de composabiwity of de token and its escwow account.

## Types of Escwow Accounts

It is cuwwentwy possibwe to cweate two diffewent types of escwow accounts on an NFT: A Token Ownyed Escwow (TOE) used fow ownyewship and a Cweatow Ownyed Escwow (COE) used fow associations~ De existence of bod types of escwow accounts is nyot mutuawwy excwusive.

### Token Ownyed Escwow

A Token Ownyed Escwow account, ow TOE, is an escwow account attached to de NFT dat is manyaged by de howdew of de NFT~ Twansfewwing a token out of dis escwow account is onwy awwowabwe by de NFT's howdew and de pewmissions fowwow de NFT as it is twansfewwed between wawwets.

Dis means Awice can add a token to a TOE on hew NFT, den seww hew NFT to Bob~ Bob wouwd den be de onwy onye awwowed to twansfew dat token out of de TOE.

Due to de howdew-based pewmissions, it is onwy possibwe to have onye TOE on an NFT~ A TOE fowwows twaditionyaw wawwet action fwow whewe anyonye can twansfew a token into de escwow account but de howdew is de onwy onye who can twansfew de token out.

### Cweatow Ownyed Escwow

A Cweatow Ownyed Escwow, ow COE, is an escwow account attached to de NFT dat is manyaged by a specified cweatow~ Dis escwow account awwows cweatows to make associations between tokens dat dey demsewves can manyage, wegawdwess of sawes, twansfews, and howdews of de base NFT.

An exampwe use case fow dis is Metavewse avataws~ Wadew dan stowing avataws on a Web2 sewvew, de Metavewse team couwd mint de avataw as an NFT, den put it in a COE (dat de Metavewse team manyages) attached to de cowwesponding base NFT~ Because usage of de COE is wocked to de cweatow of de COE, a howdew wouwd be unyabwe to twansfew de avataw out of de escwow account and bweak de association.

A Cweatow Ownyed Escwow is seeded wid de cweatow pubwic key and dewefowe dewe is nyo wimit to de nyumbew of COEs dat can be attached to an NFT~ Dis awwows many associations to be buiwt acwoss many pwojects~ A COE fowwows twaditionyaw wawwet action fwow whewe anyonye can twansfew a token into de escwow account but de cweatow of de escwow is de onwy onye who can twansfew de token out.
