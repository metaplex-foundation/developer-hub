# Launch Pools

{% callout type="warning" %}
This documentation is coming soon. Launch Pools are a gamified token distribution mechanism where user rankings determine allocation order and pricing.
{% /callout %}

## Overview

Launch Pools enable gamified token launches where:

- Users deposit SOL during a deposit window
- Your backend ranks users based on custom criteria (game performance, social engagement, etc.)
- Deposits are processed in ranked order, with higher-ranked users receiving better allocations
- The launch graduates to Raydium for permanent DEX liquidity

## Use Cases

- **Gaming launches**: Rank players by in-game performance
- **Community launches**: Rank by social engagement or contribution
- **Tiered access**: Give early supporters or top community members priority

## Coming Soon

Full documentation including:

- Setting up a Launch Pool bucket
- Configuring deposit windows
- Backend ranking and processing
- User deposit and withdrawal operations
- Graduation to Raydium

In the meantime, see the [Overview](/smart-contracts/genesis) for general Genesis concepts or explore [Bonding Curves](/smart-contracts/genesis/bonding-curves) for an alternative launch mechanism.
