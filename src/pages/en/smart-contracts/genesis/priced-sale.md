description: Collect deposits from users before token distribution with controlled allocation.

## Overview

Priced Sale enables pre-deposit token launches where:

- Users commit SOL during a priced sale window
- Deposits are collected before any token distribution occurs
- Your backend controls how and when tokens are distributed

## Use Cases

- **Early supporter access**: Let committed community members participate before public launch
- **Fundraising rounds**: Collect funds with controlled distribution
- **Fair launches**: Gather all deposits first, then distribute tokens based on custom criteria

See the [Overview](/smart-contracts/genesis) for general Genesis concepts or explore [Launch Pool](/smart-contracts/genesis/launch-pool) for an alternative launch mechanism.
