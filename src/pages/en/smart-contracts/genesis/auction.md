description: Time-based auction mechanism for token launches with uniform clearing price.
---

## Overview

Auction enables time-based token launches where:

- Users bid for a specific quantity of tokens at a specific price
- Bids can be public or private
- All winners receive tokens at the clearing price

## Use Cases

- **Price discovery**: Let the market determine the fair token price through competitive bidding
- **Whale/fund participation**: Structured auction format appeals to larger participants
- **Controlled access**: Can be gated or ungated depending on your requirements

See the [Overview](/smart-contracts/genesis) for general Genesis concepts or explore [Launch Pool](/smart-contracts/genesis/launch-pool) for an alternative launch mechanism.
