# Presales

{% callout type="warning" %}
This documentation is coming soon. Presales allow you to collect commitments from users before the main trading phase begins.
{% /callout %}

## Overview

Presales enable pre-deposit token launches where:

- Users commit SOL during a presale window
- Deposits are collected before any trading occurs
- Your backend controls how and when deposits are converted to tokens
- The launch graduates to Raydium for permanent DEX liquidity

## Use Cases

- **Early supporter access**: Let committed community members participate before public launch
- **Fundraising rounds**: Collect funds with controlled distribution
- **Fair launches**: Gather all deposits first, then distribute tokens based on custom criteria

## Coming Soon

Full documentation including:

- Setting up a Presale (Vault) bucket
- Configuring deposit and withdrawal settings
- Backend swap and refund operations
- User deposit management
- Graduation to Raydium

In the meantime, see the [Overview](/smart-contracts/genesis) for general Genesis concepts or explore [Bonding Curves](/smart-contracts/genesis/bonding-curves) for an alternative launch mechanism.
