## NFT Creation on Solana

Metaplex provides the industry-standard infrastructure for creating NFTs on Solana. With Metaplex Core, you get a modern, efficient NFT standard that reduces costs and improves performance compared to legacy solutions.

### What Are NFTs?

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets stored on the blockchain that represent ownership of items like:

- **Digital Art** - One-of-one artworks and limited edition pieces
- **Collectibles** - Trading cards, profile pictures (PFPs), and memorabilia
- **Gaming Assets** - In-game items, characters, and equipment
- **Music & Media** - Albums, videos, and exclusive content
- **Domain Names** - Blockchain-based naming services
