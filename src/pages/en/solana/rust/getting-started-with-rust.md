## Introduction

It's no doubt that if you are building on Solana you most likely have come across the term "Rust", which is the most popular language for building programs within the Solana ecosystem.

Rust can be quite a daunting task to look at and use if you are new to developing but here are some resources to get you started with Rust and the Solana ecosystem.

## The Rust Book

Start here to learn Rust. It takes from basics through to the advanced coding using the language.

## Anchor

Anchor is a framework that helps you build Solana programs by stripping away a chunk of the security boilerplate and handling it for you speeding up the development process.
