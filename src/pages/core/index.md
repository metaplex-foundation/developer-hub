Metaplex Core (“Core”) sheds the complexity and technical debt of previous standards and provides a clean and simple core spec for digital assets. This next generation Solana NFT standard uses a single account design, reducing minting costs and improving Solana network load compared to alternatives. It also has a flexible plugin system that allows for developers to modify the behavior and functionality of assets. {% .lead %}

## Introduction

Metaplex Core is the new NFT Standard by Metaplex Foundation. Compared to other Standards, including our own Token Metadata Program, it has the following advantages:

- **Unprecedented Cost Efficiency**: Metaplex Core offers the lowest minting costs compared to available alternatives. For instance, an NFT that would cost .022 SOL with Token Metadata or .0046 SOL wit Token Extensions can be minted with Core for .0029 SOL.
- **Low Compute**: Core Operations have a small Compute Unit Footprint. This allows more Transactions to be included into one block. Instead of 205000 CU for minting Core requires just 17000 CU.
- **Single Account Design**: Instead of relying on a fungible Token Standard like SPL Token or Token extensions (aka Token22) it is focusing on the needs of a NFT Standard. This allows the Program to just use a single Program that also tracks the owner.
- **Enforced Royalties**: Core allows you to [enforce Royalties](/core/plugins/royalties) by default.
- **First Class Collection Support**: Assets can be grouped into [Collections](/core/collections). While this is also possible with Token Metadata in Core Collections are their own Asset class and now allow additional features like the following:  
- **Collection Level Operations**: Core allows you to do changes for all Assets on collection level. For example freeze Assets or change royalty details with a single Transaction instead of requiring every single asset separately!
- **Advanced Plugin Support**: From built-in staking to asset-based point systems, the plugin architecture of Metaplex Core opens up a vast landscape of utility and customization. Plugins allow developers to to hook into any asset life cycle event like create, transfer and burn to add custom behaviors. You can add Plugins to your Assets. E.g. delegate permissions or add On-Chain Attributes that are automatically indexed by DAS: 
- **Out of the Box Indexing**: Many [RPC Providers supporting DAS](/rpc-providers) are already supporting Core.

## Next steps

Now that we know what Metaplex Core is at a high level, we recommend checking out our [Getting Started](/core/getting-started) page which enumerates the various languages/frameworks that one can use to interact with Core Assets. You might also want to have a look at the [Differences to MPL Token Metadata](/core/tm-differences) page. Afterwards, the various feature pages can be used to learn more about the specific operations that can be performed on cNFTs.
