The Core program is new digital asset programs by Metaplex to deal with Assets on the Solana blockchain. Its main goal is to provide a easy to use, low cost program that contains a flexible plugin system.

Metaplex Core (“Core”) sheds the complexity and technical debt of previous standards and provides a clean and simple core spec for digital assets. This makes the bare minimum use case easy and understandable for users just starting out with Digital Assets.

This next generation Solana NFT standard uses a single account design, reducing minting costs and improving Solana network load compared to alternatives. It also has a flexible plugin system that allows for users to modify the behavior of the NFTs.
