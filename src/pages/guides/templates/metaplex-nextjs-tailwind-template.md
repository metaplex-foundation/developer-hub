## Setup

### Change RPC

You are free to set up the RPC url into your project as you wish either via:

- .env
- constants.ts file
- hardcoded into umi directly

In this example the RPC url is hardcoded into the `umiStore` umi state under `src/store/useUmiStore.ts` at line `21`.

```ts
const useUmiStore = create<UmiState>()((set) => ({
  // add your own RPC here
  umi: createUmi('http://api.devnet.solana.com').use(
    signerIdentity(
      createNoopSigner(publicKey('11111111111111111111111111111111'))
    )
  ),
  ...
}))
```

## Why Zustand?

Zustand is a global store that allows you to access the store state from both hooks and regular state fetching.

By storing the umiInstance in **zustand** we can access it in both `.ts` and `.tsx` files while also having the state update via other providers and hooks such as `walletAdapter`.

While it's normally easier to use the helper methods below to access umi you can also access the state methods manually by calling for the `umiStore` state yourself.

When fetching the `umi` state directly without a helper it will only pickup the umi instance and not the latest signer. By design when the walletAdapter changes state the state of the `signer` in the `umiStore` is updated but **NOT** applied to the `umi` state. So you will need to also pull the latest `signer` state and apply it to `umi`. This behavior can be outlined in the `umiProvider.tsx` file. In contrast, the `umi` [helpers](#helpers) always pull a fresh instance of the `signer` state.

```ts
// umiProvider.tsx snippet
useEffect(() => {
  if (!wallet.publicKey) return
  // When wallet.publicKey changes, update the signer in umiStore with the new wallet adapter.
  umiStore.updateSigner(wallet as unknown as WalletAdapter)
}, [wallet, umiStore])
```

### Access Umi in .tsx

```ts
// Pulls the umi state from the umiStore using hook.
const umi = useUmiStore().umi
const signer = useUmiStore().signer

umi.use(signerIdentity(signer))
```

### Access Umi in .ts

```ts
// Pulls umi state from the umiStore.
const umi = useUmiStore.getState().umi
const signer = useUmiStore.getState().signer

umi.use(signerIdentity(signer))
```

## Helpers

Located in the `/lib/umi` folder there are some pre made helpers you can use to make your development easier.

Umi helpers are split up into several areas which can be called in different scenarios.

### Transaction Helpers

#### sendAndConfirmWithWalletAdapter()

Passing a transaction into `sendAndConfirmWithWalletAdapter()` will send the transaction while pulling the latest walletAdapter state from the zustand `umiStore` and will return the signature as a `string`. This can be accessed in both `.ts` and `.tsx` files.

The function also provides and locks in the commitment level across `blockhash`, `send`, and `confirm` if provided. By default the commitment level of `confirmed` is used if no value is passed.

There is also a `skipPreflight` flag that can be enabled if you need to debug failing transactions on chain. For more information about transactions errors you can view this guide [How to Diagnose Transaction Errors on Solana](/guides/general/how-to-diagnose-solana-transaction-errors).

`sendAndConfirmWithWalletAdapter()` comes ready for priority fees via the `setComputeUnitPrice` instruction. These should reviewed and possibly adjusted or removed depending on your situation.

```ts
import useUmiStore from '@/store/useUmiStore'
import { setComputeUnitPrice } from '@metaplex-foundation/mpl-toolbox'
import { TransactionBuilder, signerIdentity } from '@metaplex-foundation/umi'
import { base58 } from '@metaplex-foundation/umi/serializers'

const defaultPriorityFee

const sendAndConfirmWalletAdapter = async (
  tx: TransactionBuilder,
  settings?: {
    commitment?: 'processed' | 'confirmed' | 'finalized'
    skipPreflight?: boolean
  }
) => {
  const umi = useUmiStore.getState().umi
  const currentSigner = useUmiStore.getState().signer
  console.log('currentSigner', currentSigner)
  umi.use(signerIdentity(currentSigner!))

  const blockhash = await umi.rpc.getLatestBlockhash({
    commitment: settings?.commitment || 'confirmed',
  })

  const transactions = tx
    // Set the priority fee for your transaction. Can be removed if unneeded.
    .add(setComputeUnitPrice(umi, { microLamports: BigInt(100000) }))
    .setBlockhash(blockhash)

  const signedTx = await transactions.buildAndSign(umi)

  const signature = await umi.rpc
    .sendTransaction(signedTx, {
      preflightCommitment: settings?.commitment || 'confirmed',
      commitment: settings?.commitment || 'confirmed',
      skipPreflight: settings?.skipPreflight || false,
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      throw new Error(`Transaction failed: ${err}`)
    })

  const confirmation = await umi.rpc.confirmTransaction(signature, {
    strategy: { type: 'blockhash', ...blockhash },
    commitment: settings?.commitment || 'confirmed',
  })
  return {
    signature: base58.deserialize(signature),
    confirmation,
  }
}

export default sendAndConfirmWalletAdapter
```

### Umi State

#### umiWithCurrentWalletAdapter()

`umiWithCurrentWalletAdapter` fetches the current umi state with the current walletAdapter state from the `umiStore`. This can then be used to create transactions or perform operations with umi that requires the current wallet adapter user.

Can be used in both `.ts` and `.tsx` files

```ts
import useUmiStore from '@/store/useUmiStore'
import { signerIdentity } from '@metaplex-foundation/umi'

const umiWithCurrentWalletAdapter = () => {
  // Because Zustand is used to store the Umi instance, the Umi instance can be accessed from the store
  // in both hook and non-hook format. This is an example of a non-hook format that can be used in a ts file
  // instead of a React component file.

  const umi = useUmiStore.getState().umi
  const currentWallet = useUmiStore.getState().signer
  if (!currentWallet) throw new Error('No wallet selected')
  return umi.use(signerIdentity(currentWallet))
}
export default umiWithCurrentWalletAdapter
```

#### umiWithSigner()

`umiWithSigner` allows you to pass in a signer element (`generateSigner()`, `createNoopSigner()`) as an arg which is then assigned to the `umi` instance currently stored in state. This is useful for when you want an `umi` instance that uses a private key or `generatedSigner`/`createNoopSigner`.

Can be used in both `.ts` and `.tsx` files

```ts
import useUmiStore from '@/store/useUmiStore'
import { Signer, signerIdentity } from '@metaplex-foundation/umi'

const umiWithSigner = (signer: Signer) => {
  const umi = useUmiStore.getState().umi
  if (!signer) throw new Error('No Signer selected')
  return umi.use(signerIdentity(signer))
}

export default umiWithSigner
```

### Example Transaction Using Helpers

Within the `/lib` folder you will find a `transferSol` example transaction that utilizes both the fetching of the umi state using `umiWithCurrentWalletAdapter()` and the sending of the generated transaction using `sendAndConfirmWithWalletAdapter()`.

By pulling state from the umi store with `umiWithCurrentWalletAdapter()` if any of our transaction args require the `signer` type this will be automatically pulled from the umi instance which is generated with current user of `walletAdapter`. In this case the `from` account is determined by the current signer connected to umi (walletAdapter) and auto inferred in the transaction for us.

By then sending transaction with `sendAndConfirmWithWalletAdapter` the signing process will use the `walletAdapter` and ask the current user to sign the transaction. The transaction will then be sent to the chain.

```ts
// Example of a function that transfers SOL from one account to another pulling umi
// from the useUmiStore in a ts file which is not a React component.

import { transferSol } from '@metaplex-foundation/mpl-toolbox'
import umiWithCurrentWalletAdapter from './umi/umiWithCurrentWalletAdapter'
import { publicKey, sol } from '@metaplex-foundation/umi'
import sendAndConfirmWalletAdapter from './umi/sendAndConfirmWithWalletAdapter'

// This function transfers SOL from the current wallet to a destination account and is callable
// from any tsx/ts or component file in the project because of the zustand global store setup.

const transferSolToDestination = async ({
  destination,
  amount,
}: {
  destination: string
  amount: number
}) => {
  // Import Umi from `umiWithCurrentWalletAdapter`.
  const umi = umiWithCurrentWalletAdapter()

  // Create a transactionBuilder using the `transferSol` function from the mpl-toolbox.
  // Umi by default will use the current signer (walletAdapter) to also set the `from` account.
  const tx = transferSol(umi, {
    destination: publicKey(destination),
    amount: sol(amount),
  })

  // Use the sendAndConfirmWithWalletAdapter method to send the transaction.
  // We do not need to pass the umi stance or wallet adapter as an argument because a
  // fresh instance is fetched from the `umiStore` in the `sendAndConfirmWithWalletAdapter` function.
  const res = await sendAndConfirmWalletAdapter(tx)
}

export default transferSolToDestination
```
