---

The `mplx cm upload` command uploads assets to a decentralized storage and generates an `asset-cache.json` file containing upload URIs and metadata. This command provides intelligent caching, progress tracking, and comprehensive validation.

## Usage

```bash
# Upload assets from current candy machine directory
mplx cm upload

# Upload assets from specific candy machine directory
mplx cm upload <directory>
```

### Directory Structure

```text
my-candy-machine/
├── assets/
│   ├── 0.png              # Image files (PNG, JPG)
│   ├── 0.json             # Metadata files
│   ├── 1.png
│   ├── 1.json
│   ├── ...
│   ├── collection.png      # Collection image
│   └── collection.json     # Collection metadata
└── asset-cache.json        # Generated after upload
```

## Upload Process

1. Asset Discovery: The command automatically scans the `assets/` directory and identifies image, metadata and collection files.
2. Validation Phase: Verifies the integrity of your files, for example if all image files have matching metadata files and that the metadata is valid json.
3. Cache Check: To identify which files were already uploaded the `asset-cache.json` file is validated.
4. Upload: The actual upload is done.
5. Cache Generation: The `asset-cache.json` file is generated

## Generated Asset Cache

The `asset-cache.json` file contains detailed information about uploaded assets. Manually inspecting and using it is only recommended for advanced users.

Example:

```json
{
  "candyMachineId": null,
  "collection": null,
  "assetItems": {
    "0": {
      "name": "Asset #0",
      "image": "0.png",
      "imageUri": "https://gateway.irys.xyz/ABC123...",
      "imageType": "image/png",
      "json": "0.json",
      "jsonUri": "https://gateway.irys.xyz/DEF456...",
      "loaded": false
    },
    "1": {
      "name": "Asset #1",
      "image": "1.png",
      "imageUri": "https://gateway.irys.xyz/GHI789...",
      "imageType": "image/png",
      "json": "1.json",
      "jsonUri": "https://gateway.irys.xyz/JKL012...",
      "loaded": false
    }
  }
}
```
