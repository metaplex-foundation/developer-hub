```

## Notes

- This command is primarily intended for testing and development purposes
- The airdrop amount is specified in SOL (not lamports)
- If no address is provided, the SOL will be airdropped to the current wallet address
- The command requires a connection to a development network (devnet/testnet)
- Make sure you have sufficient SOL in your wallet for the airdrop operation
