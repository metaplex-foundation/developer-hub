The Metaplex Aura data network provides developers performant, reliable and accurate read access to onchain state for Solana and other SVM based chains like Eclipse.

Indexers and RPC providers often face substantial challenges in maintaining data consistency and performance. This is due to several issues:

- **Data Consistency**: Solana nodes frequently fall out of sync, and the Geyser plugin may skip updates, especially during node resynchronization. This can lead to inconsistencies in the data provided by indexers.
- **Rising Storage Costs**: As the volume of data continues to grow, maintaining and managing indices requires more storage and increases associated costs.
- **User Experience**: Fragmented data availability can result in provider lock-in, forcing users to rely on multiple RPC providers to access all their digital assets across different protocols.
