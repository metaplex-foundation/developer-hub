Choosing the right pricing model for your RPC (Remote Procedure Call) needs depends on your project’s scale, usage, and budget. Whether you're just starting, scaling, or managing enterprise-level operations, these flexible models cater to various demands:

### Free Plan

Start exploring blockchain development at no cost. Perfect for hobbyists, early-stage projects, or developers looking to test APIs without committing financially.

**Ideal For**: Beginners, small projects, or anyone just testing the waters with blockchain applications.
