Metaplex Aura is a data network that extends Solana and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

Decentralized applications struggle to compete with centralized alternatives because it can be difficult, costly and slow to read and display the current state of blockchain data. Aura solves these problems by complementing the SVM and MPL with a decentralized network of Aura nodes that performantly index asset data and provide real time data availability for compressed state, all secured by the $MPLX token.

## Reading Solana data 

Users and developers will benefit from decentralized read access on the Solana network, ensuring that digital assets and media content are always accessible, even while compressed, without relying on a single point of failure.
