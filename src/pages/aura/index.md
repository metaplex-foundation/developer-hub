Metaplex Aura is a data network that extends Solana and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

Decentralized applications struggle to compete with centralized alternatives because it can be difficult, costly and slow to read and display the current state of blockchain data. Aura solves these problems by complementing the SVM and MPL with a decentralized network of Aura nodes that performantly index asset data and provide real time data availability for compressed state, all secured by the $MPLX token.

**The Metaplex Aura Network has two main components**:
1. **Reading Solana data**: Users and developers will benefit from decentralized read access on the Solana network, ensuring that digital assets and media content are always accessible, even while compressed, without relying on a single point of failure.
2. **Managing compressed state across any SVM**: Aura implements the Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API to offer performant indexing across any protocols on Solana and the broader SVM. Developers and applications will have the ability to transition assets between SVM account space and different levels of state compression on demand, increasing flexibility and optimizing asset performance and scalability.

The Aura network can be accessed through a public gateway, which is integrated directly into the Metaplex SDKs and developer tools, providing an all-in-one solution for developers to create and manage digital assets. Alternatively, projects can choose to run a node directly and access the full benefits of the network. 

## Features

- [Reading Solana and SVM Data](/aura/reading-solana-and-svm-data): The Aura Network provides data availability and decentralized indexing for asset data, which can be queried using the [Metaplex Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API](/das-api).

- [Managing compressed state](/aura/managing-compressed-state): Aura facilitates the management of state compression on Solana and the SVM generally.
